# GDP per Capita Growth % Dataset

## A dataset utilizing machine learning to conduct analysis

The World Bank's data on countries' GDP per Capita Annual Growth % made for a good dataset to use instructive supervised and unsupervised machine learning to conduct analysis and draw decisive conclusions. The dataset included a 61 year history on the GDP per Capita Growth percentage of 212 countries. Some bias in the data exists, with missing values due to the short sovereignty of some of the nations, as well as the lack of transparency between certain countries and the World Bank. No personally identifiable information was present in this data, and the analysis was conducted for educational purposes.
